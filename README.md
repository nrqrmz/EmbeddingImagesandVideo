#Embedding Images and Video
This is Enrique and Tadeu's Microverse first project, which consists of a basic HTML/ CSS Youtube page.

The main objective of this project is to work the basics of HTML and CSS, embedding images and video to our web page.

The page structure consists of a `<header>` and one main `<section>`. This `<section>` consists of two different `<div>` one being the container and the other being the sidebar..
