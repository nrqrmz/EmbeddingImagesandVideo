# EmbeddingImagesandVideo
First Microverse project | Youtube Copy | Special Attention to branching and pull requesting

This is Enrique and Tadeu's first Microverse project which consists of a basic HTML copy of a Youtube page.

The main objective of this project is to work the basics of HTML and CSS, embedding images and video to our web page.

The page structure consists of a "header" and one main "section". This "section" consists of two different "div" one being the container and the other being the sidebar.

We hope you enjoy it.
